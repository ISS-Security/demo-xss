# HTML Injection and Cross-Site Security (XSS and CSRF) Demonstration

This project demonstrates how to conduct and prevent XSS attacks

## Install

    git clone <...>
    cd demo_xss
    bundlle install

## Execute

    ruby app.rb

Now view at the site at `http://localhost:4567` or whichever port it is on.

## Play

Look at the running site and open the 'instructions' link to see what kind of text input you could enter to conduct a script injection attack.

Search within the code of this project (`*.rb` and `views/*.slim`) for 'XSS' -- you should find comments on how make modifications to prevent XSS attacks.
